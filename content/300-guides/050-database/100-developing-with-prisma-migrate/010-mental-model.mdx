## Database migrations?

Migrations are a controlled set of changes that modify the structure of objects within your database. Migrations help you transition your database schema from one state to another, for example, creating or removing tables and columns, splitting fields in a table, or adding types and constraints to your database.

Migrations are important when working with databases because they provide a systematic way to evolve the database schema.

## Evolving a database schema

There are two main patterns in you can incrementally update your database schema:

- **Database first** — involves defining the structure of your database and applying it to your database using SQL and then _introspecting_ the database to generate the code that describes the structure of your database to sync your application and database schema

TODO: database first image

- **Code first** — involves defining the structure of the database schema using code and then using a migration tool to generate the SQL, for example, for syncing your application and database schema

TODO: code first image

Artifacts describing schema updates would ideally be stored together with your application code. It would also be tracked in version control and shared with the rest of the team working on the application.

Migrations provide _state management_ which helps with tracking the state of the database.

Migrations also allow you to replicate the state of a database at a specific point in time which is useful when collaborating with other members of the team, e.g. switching between different branches.

### Prisma Migrate

Prisma Migrate is a database migration tool that provides a _code first_ approach for managing the database schema – from your local environment all the way to production.

The workflow when using Prisma Migrate in your project would be iterative and look like this:

- Define your Prisma schema – the source of truth.
- Use one of the Prisma CLI commands to sync your Prisma schema with the database schema.

Prisma Migrate uses the following pieces of state to track the state of your database schema:

- Prisma schema: the main configuration file (data source, generators, and data models)
- Migrations history: the generated migration steps represented in `/migrations` folder
- Migrations table: table in the database that stores metadata of the already applied migrations (`_prisma_migrations`)
- Database schema: the _state_ of the database
